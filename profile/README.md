# Hi there 👋

### We make some things with Ion Channels that are present in all living beings... kinda cool, no?

## What are we doing, but for real?

For now we are:
* Moddeling an Ion Channel  using `Python` so we can distribute it as a library for _**all to use**_
* Making an `ML` model that can analyze a real Ion Channel and crunch all the bits and bobs

## 🌈 How can the community get involved?
Well actually if you feel like helping just fork any repo and feel free to do some ✨**magic**✨


## 👩‍💻 Useful resources
Docs? There are none yet...

## 🍿 Fun facts
🦍🌲 If there is a choice between jumping on a tree and working with this mess we will 9/10 times choose the tree...
